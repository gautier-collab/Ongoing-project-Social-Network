# Ongoing-project-Social-Network

This project is still in progress so it is not ready to be launched yet. 

It is a social network in which users can login, make posts, edit them and like them.

The Backend relies on Python + Django and the Frontend on JavaScript + ReactJS, with instances sotored in a SQLite database.

You can modify the time zone in project4/settings.py : TIME_ZONE = timezone_of_your_choice
